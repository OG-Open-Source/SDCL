# Task ID: 17
# Title: Parser: Enforce Form Consistency
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement logic in the parser to detect if a document mixes Expanded and Compact forms and report an error if it does.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with SDCL content that mixes forms (e.g., top-level key-value pairs followed by a root object `{...}`). Verify that the parser correctly identifies the mixed form and returns a syntax error.
