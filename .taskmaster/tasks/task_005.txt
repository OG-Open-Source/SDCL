# Task ID: 5
# Title: Lexer: Handle Whitespace and Newlines
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the lexer to correctly handle single and multiple spaces and newlines, distinguishing between significant delimiters and ignorable whitespace.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the lexer with various combinations of spaces and newlines (e.g., `key : value`, `key:
value`, `key:  
  value`). Verify that whitespace is correctly skipped or tokenized as required by the spec.
