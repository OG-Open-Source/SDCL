# Task ID: 19
# Title: Resolver: Value Reference Resolution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic within the semantic analyzer to resolve value references `(path.to.value)` by traversing the AST and linking to the target value.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with SDCL containing value references (e.g., `value1: 10
value2: (value1)`). Verify that the resolver correctly finds the target value and represents the reference in the resolved data structure.
