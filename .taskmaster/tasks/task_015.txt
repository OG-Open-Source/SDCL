# Task ID: 15
# Title: Parser: Enforce Key Naming Rules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the parser to enforce that key names do not contain spaces or dots, except when used for nested structure definition via dot-notation.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with invalid key names (e.g., `my key: value`, `my.key.name: value` where `my.key.name` is intended as a single key, not nested). Verify that the parser correctly identifies and reports these syntax errors.
