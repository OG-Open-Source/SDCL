# Title: Resolver: Implement 'Last Definition Wins'
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the 'last definition wins' rule for merging/overriding keys during content inclusion resolution.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with SDCL where a key is defined in both the source and target of a merge inclusion (e.g., `obj1: { a: 1, b: 2 }
obj2: { b: 3, c: 4 }
final: (obj1) (obj2)`). Verify that the key from the later inclusion (`obj2.b`) overrides the earlier one (`obj1.b`).
