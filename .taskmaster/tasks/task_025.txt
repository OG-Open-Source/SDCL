# Task ID: 25
# Title: Resolver: Circular Reference Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement algorithms to detect and report errors for circular dependencies involving value references, content inclusions, and external `.sdcl` references.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with SDCL containing circular references (e.g., `a: (b)
b: (a)`, `obj1: (obj2)
obj2: (obj1)`, file A includes file B, file B includes file A). Verify that the resolver detects the cycle and returns an appropriate error.
