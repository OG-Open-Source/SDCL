# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Lexer Core
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the core logic of the lexer (tokenizer) to read input character by character and identify the start of potential tokens.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Create basic test cases with simple inputs (e.g., `key: "value"`) and verify that the lexer can read characters and identify basic token boundaries. Use Go's `testing` package. Consider using `bufio.Reader` for efficient character reading.
