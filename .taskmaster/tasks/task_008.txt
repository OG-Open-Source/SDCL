# Task ID: 8
# Title: Lexer: Ensure UTF-8 Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the lexer correctly handles multi-byte UTF-8 characters in strings and keys using Go's `rune` type.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the lexer with SDCL content containing non-ASCII UTF-8 characters in strings and keys (e.g., `ключ: "значение"`, `你好: "世界"`). Verify that the lexer correctly reads and tokenizes these characters.
