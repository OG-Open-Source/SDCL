# Task ID: 10
# Title: Parser: Top-Level Document Parsing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the parser logic to handle the top-level structure of an SDCL document, which consists of a sequence of key-value pairs, comments, and inclusions.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with simple top-level key-value pairs and comments (e.g., `key1: value1
key2: value2
# comment`). Verify that the parser correctly builds the top-level AST nodes.
