# Task ID: 24
# Title: Resolver: External .sdcl Reference Resolution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the resolution of `.file.sdcl.path` references, including setting up a file loader with a configurable search path strategy.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Create mock `.sdcl` files and write unit tests that parse a main file referencing them (e.g., `include: (.file.sdcl.other.sdcl)`). Configure search paths and verify that the resolver can find and parse the external file and include its content.
