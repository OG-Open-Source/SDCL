# Task ID: 27
# Title: Data Conversion to Standard Go Types
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the final conversion of the internal resolved data structure (likely the result of the semantic analysis) into standard Go types (`map[string]interface{}` and `[]interface{}`).
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
After resolving a sample AST, convert it to `map[string]interface{}`. Write tests to verify that the structure and data types in the resulting Go map/slice match the expected output based on the resolved SDCL.
