# Title: Parser: Enforce Double-Quoted Strings
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the parser to enforce that all literal strings are enclosed in double quotes (`"`).
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with invalid SDCL containing single-quoted or unquoted strings (e.g., `key: 'value'`, `key: value`). Verify that the parser correctly identifies these as syntax errors.
