# Title: Resolver: Content Inclusion Resolution (Merge)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic to resolve content inclusion references `(path.to.structure)` by merging the content of the referenced object or array into the current scope.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with SDCL containing merge inclusions (e.g., `obj1: { a: 1 }
obj2: (obj1)`). Verify that the resolver correctly merges the content of `obj1` into `obj2`.
