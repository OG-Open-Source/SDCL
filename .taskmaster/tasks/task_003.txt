# Task ID: 3
# Title: Define AST Node Structures
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Define Go interfaces and structs to represent the nodes of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the SDCL structure.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Review the Go code to ensure interfaces (e.g., `Node`, `Expression`, `Statement`) and concrete structs (e.g., `Document`, `ObjectLiteral`, `ArrayLiteral`, `KeyValuePair`, `StringLiteral`, `ValueReference`) are defined to cover all SDCL constructs.
