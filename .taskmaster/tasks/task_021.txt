# Task ID: 21
# Title: Resolver: Content Inclusion Resolution (Embed)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic to resolve content inclusion references `((path.to.structure))` by embedding the entire referenced structure (including its key) into the current scope.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with SDCL containing embed inclusions (e.g., `obj1: { a: 1 }
obj2: ((obj1))`). Verify that the resolver correctly embeds `obj1` as a nested structure within `obj2`.
