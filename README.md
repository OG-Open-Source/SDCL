# SDCL (OGATA's Standard Data Character Storage Language) Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for SDCL (OGATA's Standard Data Character Storage Language), a human-readable and machine-parsable data storage format designed for configuration management and data referencing.

The documentation is provided in ISO standard format across multiple languages to ensure broad accessibility and clarity.

## Available Documentation

- **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文):** [`sdcl_zh_hant.md`](sdcl_zh_hant.md)
- **English:** [`sdcl_en.md`](sdcl_en.md)
- **Simplified Chinese (简体中文):** [`sdcl_zh_hans.md`](sdcl_zh_hans.md)

Each document adheres to the ISO standard format, providing a comprehensive guide to SDCL's syntax, semantics, data types, referencing mechanisms, and unique features.

## Purpose

The SDCL documentation serves as a definitive reference for:

- SDCL parser developers
- Data architects
- Application developers utilizing SDCL for data exchange or configuration management

It aims to facilitate modular configuration and data reuse through its robust internal and external referencing mechanisms, while maintaining a strict syntax for simplified parsing and reduced ambiguity.
